From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
This is an assignment to breakdown the HTML and CSS of the google homepage and reconstruct it with my awful spaghetti noodle code skills.

Unfortunately didn't get much done atm, set up the base code of the HTML doc. Got the image and a basic search bar set up, reallllly struggling to center the damn things in CSS. I hopefully will get a lot more done this weekend, going to continue messing with the positioning till I figure it out. Chrome Dev kit has been useful giving me general ideas, but W3 and HTML dog are great reminders. DO NOT FORGET THE LINK TO YOUR STYLE SHEET IN THE FUTURE!!!
