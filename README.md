From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
This is an assignment to breakdown the HTML and CSS of the google homepage and reconstruct it with my awful spaghetti noodle code skills.

Unfortunately didn't get much done atm, set up the base code of the HTML doc. Got the image and a basic search bar set up, reallllly struggling to center the damn things in CSS. I hopefully will get a lot more done this weekend, going to continue messing with the positioning till I figure it out. Chrome Dev kit has been useful giving me general ideas, but W3 and HTML dog are great reminders. DO NOT FORGET THE LINK TO YOUR STYLE SHEET IN THE FUTURE!!!

Took a break from coding for two days. Was working on ideas at work and am now implementing them today on the project. Managed to figure out how to position the logo and search bar, mostly...I'm sure there is a better way to write it. Going to start onthe header//footer, I keep getting sucked into minor details with trying to copy the actual website too closely. I continue to you inspect to get ideas but I think I may be cheating a bit too much.

I took a break for breakfast, back at it trying to solve the header and footer situation.

I have completed the footer and search buttons. However the links in the footer are improperly spaced atm. It looks really close to a google homepage, must missing the sign in portion in the top right, that is the next area to set up, afterwards I can go through fioner details....maybe.
